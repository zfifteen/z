Universal Form
Z = A(B/C)
A = reference frame–dependent measured quantity (limited by C in regimes)
B = Rate
C = Invariant universal limit of B (cannot be set or changed; enforces bounds on A in regimes)
D = All possible set of A, C pairs

Regime Definition
- A regime is the set of all possible domains that share a property (e.g., the same invariant C, analogous invariance types, or compatible logical geometries).

Domain Definition
- A domain is all possible measures (A and B) that are compatible with C.

Logical Decomposition of D
- D decomposes into derivatives capturing A’s behavior under C’s immutability. The 10 most valuable derivatives (prioritized for empirical insight, sensitivity, boundary mapping, and cross-domain unification) are:
  1. dZ/dA = B/C: Measures Z’s sensitivity to changes in A, scaled by the rate B relative to C. High value in quantifying frame-dependent effects, e.g., time dilation in physical domains (A = T, B = v, C = c).
  2. dZ/dB = A/C: Captures Z’s response to rate changes, highlighting A’s scaling under C’s limit. Valuable for rate-bound analyses, e.g., velocity impacts in relativistic regimes.
  3. dZ/dC = -A B / C²: Theoretical sensitivity of Z to C variations (despite immutability), revealing limit-shift implications. Essential for understanding boundary stresses in domains.
  4. dA/dC = 0: Affirms C’s immutability, bounding A without variation. Core value in enforcing regime stability across all domains.
  5. d²Z/dC² = 2 A B / C³: Second-order curvature of Z w.r.t. C, indicating acceleration in limit effects. Valuable for geometric insights in regime spans, e.g., spacetime curvature analogs.
  6. d²Z/(dA dB) = 1/C: Mixed derivative showing interplay between A and B under C. High utility in cross-rate-frame analyses, unifying discrete and continuous domains.
  7. d²Z/(dA dC) = -B / C²: Captures joint sensitivity of A and C on Z, embedding rate B’s influence. Valuable for boundary explorations in D’s pairs.
  8. d²Z/(dB dC) = -A / C²: Reflects rate-limit interactions on Z, with A’s frame-dependence. Essential for historical embedding in multi-domain regimes.
  9. ∂D/∂A: Defines the range of A values compatible with fixed C, outlining D’s logical boundary. Critical for mapping measure compatibilities within domains.
  10. Cross-domain derivatives (e.g., dZ/dA across regimes): Unify D by comparing behaviors for different A’s sharing C’s property, e.g., linking physical (A = T) and quantum (A = E) under c. Supreme value in regime integration and geometric coherence.
